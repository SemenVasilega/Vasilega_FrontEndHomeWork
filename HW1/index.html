        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in 1967 
            as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the <br>
            Biafran army. After the war he completed 
            high-school equivalence through self-study. He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]

        <h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
        <p>
            Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by 
            a committee of internal and external examiners <br> 
            and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, 
            stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated <br> 
            against him in several 
            ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of Appeals.[8]
